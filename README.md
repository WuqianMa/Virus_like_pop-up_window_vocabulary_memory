# Vocabulary Flashcard App

This is a **React-based Vocabulary Flashcard Web App** that dynamically displays random words with their translations. The app reads a CSV file containing vocabulary words and their translations, then periodically shows them in animated flashcards with random colors and positions.

## üöÄ Features
![Description of GIF](https://github.com/WuqianMa/Virus_like_pop-up_window_vocabulary_memory/blob/main/ex.gif)

- Reads vocabulary words and translations from a **CSV file**.
- Displays flashcards that appear at random positions on the screen.
- Automatically cycles through words at a set interval.
- Ensures **font size scales** with the card size for better readability.
- **Adaptive font size**: If a translation exceeds 10 words, it is displayed in a smaller font.
- Deployed via **GitHub Pages** for easy access.

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation & Setup

cd REPOSITORY-NAME
```

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Install Dependencies**
```sh
npm install
```

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Run the Development Server**
```sh

This will start the app at `http://localhost:3000/`.

### **4Ô∏è‚É£ Building for Production**
If you want to create a production build, run:

This will generate an optimized `build/` folder.

### **5Ô∏è‚É£ Running the Production Build Locally**
To test the production build locally, install `serve`:
```sh
npm install -g serve
```
Then, run:
```sh
serve -s build
```
This will start a local server, and you can access your app at `http://localhost:5000/`.

## üìÅ CSV File Format
Ensure you have a `EnWords.csv` file in the `public/` directory, structured as:

"scripts": {
  "predeploy": "npm run build",
  "deploy": "gh-pages -d build"
}
```

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Deploy**
```sh
npm run deploy
